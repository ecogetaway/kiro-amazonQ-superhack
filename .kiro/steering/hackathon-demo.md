# Hackathon Demo Guidelines

This steering document provides specific guidelines for demo scenarios and presentation.

## Demo Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Incident Correlation
**Setup**: Load 10 sample incidents with 3 clear correlation groups
**Agent Actions**: 
- Correlation agent analyzes incidents in real-time
- Shows decision-making process with confidence scores
- Demonstrates learning from technician feedback
**Key Points**: Highlight autonomous decision-making and reasoning

### Scenario 2: Proactive Monitoring
**Setup**: Simulate CloudWatch metrics with anomalies
**Agent Actions**:
- Monitoring agent detects anomalies automatically
- Generates "top 3 issues" with prioritization reasoning
- Shows preventive action recommendations
**Key Points**: Emphasize predictive capabilities and business impact

### Scenario 3: Problem Management
**Setup**: Show recurring incident pattern over time
**Agent Actions**:
- Problem agent identifies pattern autonomously
- Creates problem record with root cause analysis
- Coordinates resolution activities across teams
**Key Points**: Demonstrate pattern recognition and orchestration

### Scenario 4: Multi-Agent Coordination
**Setup**: Complex scenario requiring multiple agents
**Agent Actions**:
- Supervisor coordinates incident → correlation → problem workflow
- Shows conflict resolution between agents
- Demonstrates system-wide optimization
**Key Points**: Highlight agentic collaboration and intelligence

## Presentation Tips

### Technical Depth
- Show actual AI decision-making processes
- Explain confidence scores and reasoning
- Demonstrate learning and adaptation
- Highlight autonomous vs. human-supervised actions

### Business Value
- Quantify time savings from automation
- Show reduction in duplicate work
- Demonstrate proactive issue prevention
- Highlight improved SLA compliance

### Agentic AI Features
- Emphasize autonomous decision-making
- Show agent-to-agent communication
- Demonstrate conflict resolution
- Highlight continuous learning capabilities

## Demo Flow Timing
- **5 minutes**: Problem overview and solution introduction
- **10 minutes**: Live demo of all four scenarios
- **3 minutes**: Technical architecture and AWS integration
- **2 minutes**: Business impact and next steps
