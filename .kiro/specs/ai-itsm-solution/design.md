### Agentic AI Architecture

The system implements truly autonomous agents that make decisions, take actions, and learn from outcomes. Each agent operates independently while collaborating through a supervisor agent:

**Supervisor Agent**: Orchestrates the multi-agent system, delegates tasks, and coordinates responses
1. **Incident Correlation Agent**: Autonomously groups incidents, decides on correlation confidence, and creates problem suggestions
2. **Proactive Monitoring Agent**: Independently analyzes metrics, makes severity decisions, and triggers automated responses
3. **Problem Management Agent**: Autonomously identifies root causes, creates problem records, and suggests preventive actions
4. **Critical Response Agent**: Makes real-time escalation decisions and automatically initiates response workflows
5. **Analytics Agent**: Independently generates insights, identifies trends, and provides predictive recommendations

### Agent Autonomy Features

Each agent demonstrates key agentic capabilities:
- **Decision Making**: Agents evaluate data and make autonomous decisions without human intervention
- **Action Execution**: Agents can create tickets, send alerts, update records, and trigger workflows
- **Learning**: Agents improve their decision-making based on feedback and outcomes
- **Collaboration**: Agents communicate and coordinate with each other through the supervisor
- **Goal-Oriented Behavior**: Each agent works toward specific ITSM objectives while adapting to changing conditions
