# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a hackathon prototype of an AI-powered IT Service Management (ITSM) solution using Amazon Bedrock AgentCore and AWS services. The prototype will demonstrate the core value proposition through three key features: automated incident correlation, proactive health monitoring, and basic performance reporting. The goal is to build a working demonstration that showcases the potential of AI agents in IT operations within hackathon constraints.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a hackathon judge, I want to see a working demo of automated incident correlation, so that I can understand how AI can reduce duplicate work in IT operations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN sample incident tickets are provided THEN the system SHALL analyze ticket descriptions using text similarity
2. WHEN similar tickets are found THEN the system SHALL group them and display the correlation results
3. WHEN demonstrating the feature THEN the system SHALL show before/after scenarios with clear metrics
4. WHEN processing tickets THEN the system SHALL complete analysis within 30 seconds for demo purposes
5. WHEN displaying results THEN the system SHALL show confidence scores and reasoning for correlations

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a hackathon judge, I want to see proactive monitoring in action, so that I can understand how AI can predict and prevent IT issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN CloudWatch metrics are simulated or provided THEN the system SHALL analyze them for anomalies
2. WHEN issues are detected THEN the system SHALL generate a "top 3 issues" report with explanations
3. WHEN demonstrating the feature THEN the system SHALL show real-time analysis of sample infrastructure data
4. WHEN generating alerts THEN the system SHALL provide actionable recommendations for each issue
5. WHEN displaying results THEN the system SHALL present findings in a clear, prioritized format

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a hackathon judge, I want to see problem management integration with incident correlation, so that I can understand how AI identifies root causes and prevents recurring issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multiple related incidents are correlated THEN the system SHALL automatically suggest creating a problem record
2. WHEN analyzing incident patterns THEN the system SHALL identify potential root causes based on historical data
3. WHEN demonstrating problem management THEN the system SHALL show how incidents escalate to problems
4. WHEN suggesting solutions THEN the system SHALL recommend preventive actions based on similar resolved problems
5. WHEN displaying problem analysis THEN the system SHALL show the relationship between incidents and underlying problems

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a hackathon judge, I want to see critical incident prioritization and reporting, so that I can understand how AI handles severity-based escalation and management visibility.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing incidents THEN the system SHALL automatically classify severity levels (P1, P2, P3) based on impact and urgency
2. WHEN P1/P2 incidents are detected THEN the system SHALL trigger immediate escalation workflows
3. WHEN demonstrating critical incidents THEN the system SHALL show real-time dashboards for high-severity issues
4. WHEN generating reports THEN the system SHALL provide executive summaries of critical incident trends
5. WHEN displaying severity metrics THEN the system SHALL show SLA compliance and breach predictions

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a hackathon judge, I want to see an AI agent generate performance insights and trend analysis, so that I can understand the potential for automated operational reporting.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN sample IT metrics are provided THEN the system SHALL calculate KPIs including MTTR, incident volume by severity, and resolution trends
2. WHEN generating reports THEN the system SHALL create visualizations showing incident patterns and performance trends
3. WHEN demonstrating analytics THEN the system SHALL show predictive insights for capacity planning and resource allocation
4. WHEN displaying insights THEN the system SHALL highlight actionable recommendations for process improvement
5. WHEN processing data THEN the system SHALL complete analysis and generate reports within the demo timeframe
