# Implementation Plan - Hackathon Prototype

- [x] 1. Set up minimal project foundation
  - Create basic project structure with Python modules for core agents
  - Set up development environment with essential dependencies (boto3, openai, fastapi, streamlit)
  - Create simple configuration management for API keys and settings
  - _Requirements: Foundation for all prototype features_

- [x] 2. Create sample data and basic data models
  - Define simple Incident and Alert data classes
  - Generate 20-30 sample incidents with realistic descriptions and metadata
  - Create sample CloudWatch-style metrics data for demo purposes
  - _Requirements: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5_

- [x] 3. Build core Incident Correlation Agent (MVP)
  - Implement basic text similarity using OpenAI embeddings or sentence transformers
  - Create simple correlation logic that groups incidents by similarity score
  - Build decision-making function that autonomously decides correlation confidence
  - Test with sample data to demonstrate grouping capabilities
  - _Requirements: 1, 3_

- [ ] 4. Create Proactive Monitoring Agent (MVP)
  - Build simple anomaly detection using statistical thresholds on sample metrics
  - Implement "top 3 issues" generation with autonomous prioritization logic
  - Create alert generation that makes decisions about severity and urgency
  - Generate sample alerts with explanations and recommended actions
  - _Requirements: 2, 4_

- [ ] 5. Implement basic Problem Management integration
  - Create logic to identify when correlated incidents should become problems
  - Build autonomous decision-making for problem record creation
  - Implement simple root cause suggestion based on incident patterns
  - Demonstrate problem lifecycle from incident correlation to resolution
  - _Requirements: 3, 4_

- [ ] 6. Build simple multi-agent coordination
  - Create basic Supervisor Agent that coordinates the other agents
  - Implement simple workflow: incidents → correlation → monitoring → problem management
  - Add basic conflict resolution when agents have different recommendations
  - Demonstrate agents working together autonomously on sample scenarios
  - _Requirements: All requirements - shows agentic coordination_

- [ ] 7. Create Streamlit demo dashboard
  - Build simple web interface showing real-time agent decisions and actions
  - Display incident correlation results with confidence scores and reasoning
  - Show proactive monitoring alerts and "top 3 issues" with agent explanations
  - Demonstrate problem management workflow with autonomous decision points
  - _Requirements: All requirements - visual demonstration of agentic capabilities_

- [ ] 8. Add basic Amazon Bedrock integration
  - Configure connection to Amazon Bedrock for LLM-powered decision making
  - Use Bedrock models for text analysis and decision reasoning
  - Implement simple prompt engineering for agent decision explanations
  - Test integration with sample data to ensure reliability during demo
  - _Requirements: All requirements - Bedrock provides the AI reasoning capability_

- [ ] 9. Implement demo scenarios and automation
  - Create 3-4 compelling demo scenarios showing different agent capabilities
  - Build automated demo flow that runs through scenarios without manual intervention
  - Add realistic timing and decision-making delays to show agent "thinking"
  - Create clear narrative explaining what each agent is doing and why
  - _Requirements: All requirements - scenarios demonstrate the complete prototype_

- [ ] 10. Add basic observability and demo polish
  - Implement simple logging to show agent decision-making processes
  - Add performance timing to demonstrate speed of autonomous decisions
  - Create simple metrics showing agent effectiveness (correlation accuracy, alert relevance)
  - Polish UI with clear explanations of agentic AI capabilities and decision reasoning
  - _Requirements: All requirements - observability proves the agents are truly autonomous_
